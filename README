### Setup

In order to pull in the files to the local directory, git needs to be configured using the following steps [source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2411031/how-do-i-clone-into-a-non-empty-directory)

```
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:ginoclement/bash_settings.git
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master
```

This can also be done by sourcing one of the files:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ginoclement/bash_settings/master/setup.sh | sh`
